  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I am a senior systems and network engineer with an architectural focus on
    secure, resilient infrastructure. I design and implement server platforms
    and the networks that connect them, with particular expertise in VLAN
    segmentation, VPN architecture, and network isolation for enterprise,
    government, and regulated environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have led the design and implementation of environments aligned with
    NIST security frameworks, helping clients meet regulatory requirements
    while maintaining eligibility for cyber-insurance coverage. I have worked
    directly with state government systems and have maintained CJIS/CJIN
    certification for many years, giving me deep familiarity with
    compliance-driven design and operational realities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond architecture and operations, I bring an adversarial mindset to
    security. I have professional experience with software-based red teaming,
    which informs how I approach segmentation, access control, monitoring,
    and recovery planning.
  </p>

  <p>
    I emphasize automation, standardization, and long-term maintainability.
    I have built extensive tooling in PowerShell, Python, and Bash to reduce
    operational overhead and make complex systems easier to understand,
    audit, and recover.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of work, I’m a lifelong nerd with a love for comic books and
    tabletop RPGs such as D&amp;D, Fate/Fudge, and GURPS, and I pursue
    locksport as a hobby. I’m also an avid photographer and a fan of the
    natural landscapes of New England, spending time outdoors whenever I can.
    That appreciation for structure, detail, and perspective—whether in
    systems or in nature—shapes how I approach both my technical work and
    creative pursuits.
